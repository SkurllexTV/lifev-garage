# lifev-garage
(Original) Free Release of the lifev-garage due to multiple resellers.

## Code 
The whole code is atleast 3+ years old and for that also very outdated.

To make sure **yes** you can use it for your current server **but** you need to change the shared object to the new export and also *maybe* adapt the server code to allow the creation of job-garages based on the job of the current garage.
The current code does not support it and is hardcoded (cuz at this time it wasn't needed).

## Contribution
If you want to contribute feel free to do so.

## Scripts version, *copies* or *resellers*
There are many versions of either this script or just design copies with **shitty** even more outdated backend code and also most of the time **shitty** frontend code don't use it.
**Use this version** its the last known original used version of the old project.
